MapView
The mapView.png does not affect the performance of the neural network; it will simply be the image of the track. Use whatever you wish.

MapCollision
The mapCollision.png will be loaded by the program to define the walls, the car spawn area, and the endpoint of the map.

Colors and descriptions:

White (255, 255, 255): Area where cars can move
Black (0, 0, 0): Area where there are walls cars can collide with 
Red (255, 0, 0): Defines the car spawn points (two red points needed)
Yellow (255, 255, 0): Defines the endpoint of the map
